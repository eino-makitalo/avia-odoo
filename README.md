# avia-odoo
Dockerfile and build dir for emakital/avia-odoo  
docker image to run local scout group Aviapartio accounting with Odoo

To use this you do not need anything else than Dockerfile.  (odoo/dockerfile)
and docker-compose.yml  They load Odoo 9 and extra addons needed to run 
accounting software with Kuksa.  The Work is in progress still.  My integration
with Kuksa is based to Excel/csv output and some python scripts to run to
send all invoices and customers (scouts and their parents) to Odoo.
I have also build some addons.

##Addons

### account_bank_statement_import_oko
My add on OKO Bank csv inmport is almost similar than Avoin System. My plan is to keep it as similar as
possible with Avoin System
### l10n_fi_invoice
Finnish invoice module is based on Miku's but I add reference number matching editing possibility because
in our local scout group - most of invoices are generated by Kuksa https://kuksa.partio.fi and we just import then.
I also add possibility to edit reference number when invoice is in Draft state

### l10n_fi_scouts
This module adds Invoices Kuksa invoice number and makes nice link to Kuksa invoice handling system where original PDF versions of
invoices is kept.
